Hello!

Here are codes to calculate Solar space velocity from nearby stars. The results have been analyzed in our paper with the title 'From Nearby Stars to Solar Kinematics: New Insight from Gaia DR2 Catalogue'. 

The codes are written in Python programming language as follows:
1. identify_MS_stars.py
This file contains code to identify the Main-Sequence and Non-Main-Sequence of selected stars.
2. Solar_space_velocity.py
This file contains code to:
- select FGK Main-Sequence stars,
- calculate the average velocity of the stars with respect to the Sun,
- calculate the asymmetric drift,
- calculate the Solar space velocity with respect to the LSR.

If any discussion or questions about these codes, please contact us at darmarendy@gmail.com or wulanddarii18@gmail.com.

Thank you!
